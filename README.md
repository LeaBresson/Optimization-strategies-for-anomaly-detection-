# Optimization strategies for anomaly detection with One class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM)

Project for the course "Optimization for Data Science" (lecturer: Alexandre Gramfort, Master Data Science)

## Aims
- Derive the dual for the one-class SVM model,

- implement a one-class SVM using a blackbox convex toolbox (cvxopt in Python),

- implement your own solvers with: Proximal gradient, Coordinate Descent, Quasi-Newton,

- present a clear benchmark of the different strategies on small and medium scale datasets.
